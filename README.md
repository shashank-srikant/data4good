# data4good

Hi! Welcome. 

I hope you have watched [this little introduction video](https://youtube.com) which motivates what this iniatitive is all about.

For you to benefit the most from this initiative, we feel you ought to have worked on at least one small project in Python - anything that demonstrates the different aspects of programming and Python you have already explored.

Hence, for you to meaningfully participate in this iniatitive, **please show off to us what you know in Python**. 

Use this as an opportunity to show us what you have worked on in the past. 

Concretely, please upload **your favorite Python project/program, along with a short description of why that project is special to you** on your GitHub account, and share it with us. See the section **How to submit my Python project** below for details.

# FAQs
## 1. What will I learn from this `data4good` initiative? How is this relevant to me?
Please watch [this little introduction video](https://youtube.com) first :-) We address the motivations there.

## 2. I am totally new to programming, but I'm interested in learning more about data science. I would like to participate in `data4good`.
Great! We would have loved for you to be a part of this iniatitive. 

Unfortunately though, we do not currently have the required bandwidth to help you with your goals of learning both programming and data science.

We feel those with some minimum programming experience will be able to benefit most from what we have to offer.

It is perfectly alright that you are not comfortable with programming -- it is never too late :-)

Please continue to work and practice your programming skills in Python, and when you are comfortable with it, we 

## 3. I have worked on some projects, but all that work is in programming language X, where X != Python. What do I do?
Great!

It is very cool you have picked up programming in X and have tried exploring some projects in it.

However, for you to benefit from this initiative, it is necessary for you to have a working knowledge of Python.

Since you have already worked on a project in X, why don't you try implementing the same idea in Python? Or pick any other project, and learn how to implement it in Python. Once you have implemented it, please share that with us, and we will get you started. Learning the basics of Python should not take you more than a week if you are already familiar with another language X.

## 4. What do you mean by a _project_ in Python? I have written some short example programs. Is that enough to participate?

A project here means you should have spent some time in programming in Python to accomplish some "interesting" outcome.

This example Python program
```
for i in range(10):
  print(i, "\n")
```
prints 0 to 9 on new lines, and is not really that interesting. 

We want you to show us what more you have done with Python. Examples can include writing Python scripts to automate small tasks on your computer, writing a small game in Python, writing a controller to move around a robot, etc.

See some examples here --

https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/

If you feel you are comfortable with programming in Python and are unsure whether the project you have in mind meets this above criterion, do not worry :-) Just go ahead and submit your work.

## 5. I have done some data analysis. But I have used R/MS Excel/VBA/Matlab/Octave to analyze it. I'd like to participate.

Great!

Although we would love for you to participate, unfortunatley, we currently are unable to support different programming environments to analyze data. 

You will benefit most from this initiative if you have some exposure to Python, and it is _really easy_ to pick up Python.

Please refer to FAQ #3 for details on next steps.

# How to submit my Python project
Alright, if you've been through the above questions, and are eager to show off your Python project project with us, please follow these steps -- 

1. Create an account on GitHub. GitHub is used by people to store and share source code. You can read more in [this tutorial on getting started with GitHub](https://medium.com/@sauravbhagat_10426/how-to-upload-code-to-github-6db1c8ff56aa).

2. Create a _public repository_ on your GitHub account called `data4good-application`.

3. Upload your code in your `data4good-application` repository. Upload your source file (.py extension) directly. 

4. Edit the `README.md` file in your `data4good-application` repository, and describe in a few lines -
- what your program does.
- what steps we need to take to reproduce the results of your program.
- why you chose to submit this project.

See this [informative blog](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project) on the importance of good README files, and how to write an informative one.

5. Once you have created your repository, [fill in this application](https://forms.google.com), and paste the URL of your `data4good-application` repository when submitting your application so that we can go through your work.
